# PUC-2017-at-UBC---Analyzing-a-Technical-Analysis-Strategy-in-Bot-Trading-Bitcoin
My partner (Maximilian Was-Damji, UBC Honors Physics) and I (SFU Computer Engineering) sought to analyse one popular method of technical analysis used in bot-trading, the exponential moving average (EMA) crossover strategy. We utilized an in-house python program coded to simulated a bot-trader using every combination of lower and upper EMAs ranging from an EMA multiplier value of 0-100% (1% intervals) over a volatile two month period in Bitcoin's past price. The bitcoin price data was fetched through an API from the Poloniex exchange. The results of our data effectively showed the most profitable combinations of EMA multipliers for the crossover strategy, having run the program with and without transaction fees as a variable. We also analysed the relationship between the number of transactions with the profit yield. 

The python code had originally been written by my partner and I had helped make contributions to updates/changes in our code as we decided the path of our project. I used MatLab to plan, sort, and generate all data into graphics and calculate all statistical values associated with the project. I've provided the MatLab code for calculating figure 1.1 and 1.2 in **"Transaction_Interest.m"**, the code for calculating all other figures are relatively the same other than the input data and titles.
